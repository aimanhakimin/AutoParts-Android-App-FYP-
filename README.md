Car Maintenance App

This application is designed for car owners seeking an all-in-one solution to manage their vehicles. It features a Car Maintenance Log, a Component Price Tracker, and a Workshop Locator.

The app is primarily built with Dart, while Python is integrated for web scraping functions using BeautifulSoup4 to gather data on car component prices from various websites. The Android application and the Python web scraper are connected via a Flask server.
